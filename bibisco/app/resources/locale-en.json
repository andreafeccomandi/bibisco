  "jsp.suggestedReadings.book.egri.description": "Learn the basic techniques every successful playwright knows Among the many \"how-to\" playwriting books that have appeared over the years, there have been few that attempt to analyze the mysteries of play construction. Lajos Egriʼs classic, The Art of Dramatic Writing, does just that, with instruction that can be applied equally well to a short story, novel, or screenplay. Examining a play from the inside out, Egri starts with the heart of any drama: its characters. All good dramatic writing hinges on people and their relationships, which serve to move the story forward and give it life, as well as an understanding of human motives -- why people act the way that they do. Using examples from everything from William Shakespeareʼs Romeo and Juliet to Henrik Ibsenʼs A Dollʼs House, Egri shows how it is essential for the author to have a basic premise -- a thesis, demonstrated in terms of human behavior -- and to develop the dramatic conflict on the basis of that behavior. Using Egriʼs ABCs of premise, character, and conflict, The Art of Dramatic Writing is a direct, jargon-free approach to the problem of achieving truth in writing.",

  "jsp.suggestedReadings.book.marks.description": "What is the secret to writing a great screenplay? Whether youʼre a beginning screenwriter or an A-list Academy Award winner, all writers struggle with the same thing: to get to the great script inside. Step by step, Inside Story: The Power of the Transformational Arc guides you through an extraordinary new process that helps identify your thematic intention-what your story is really about-and teaches you how to turn that intention into the driving force behind all your creative choices. The result is a profound relationship between the movement of the plot and the internal development of character, which is the foundation for the transformational arc. The transformational arc is the deeper line of structure found inside the story. Knowing how to work with the arc enhances your ability to: 1) Express your unique point of view 2) Give meaning and urgency to the line of action 3) Infuse your characters with richness, subtlety, and surprise 4) Develop a powerful emotional undercurrent 5) Make your stories stand out and get attention A strong transformational arc is the single most important element that makes the difference between a good screenplay and a great one. Inside Story delivers what the name implies: itʼs the real inside scoop on how to write a great screenplay with depth, dimension, and substance. It is a must-have for any serious screenwriter, playwright, or novelist.",
