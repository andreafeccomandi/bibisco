<h4>3. Define a premise</h4>
<p>The premise contains the entire novel in just one sentence: conflict and its resolution.</p>
<p>Let's suppose your novel to be about a young man that leaves his small town to go to New York, in seek of fortune as an actor. After several failures and humiliations, he finally reaches success. In this case, premise could be: Will of standing out (conflict) and determination lead to success (resolution).</p>
<p>Premise is the guide to the novel: conclusion must be reached starting from conflict.</p>
<p>If premise is clear, everything comes easier. For example, for our aspiring actor, determination and artistic sense could be revealed since the first chapters, by narrating that during his childhood he passed an entire summer helping his grandmother decorating one of her kitchen's walls, creating a huge mosaic of every kind of fruits and vegetables.</p>
