<h4>6. How is the story narrated? Choose the point of view.</h4>
<p>Each point of view has specific features, with pros and cons. Here you have an overview.</p>
<p><em>First person: </em>the story is narrated in first person by one of the main characters. The story is filtered through character's senses and thoughts: this means narration must be coherent with his intelligence and vocabulary. The character can only narrate events he actually knows.
</p>
<p><em>Secondary first person: </em>the story is narrated in first person by a secondary character, who is not the protagonist of narrated events. This point of view must be used if main charachters are not aware of their actions and therefore are not able to correctly narrate their story. The narrator does not know main characters' thoughts and can narrate only events that he has witnessed.
</p>
<p><em>Limited third person: </em>the story is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has only access to a main character's thoughts and actions. Narration is more unrestrained than in first person and is not necessarily coherent with intelligence and language of the character. The character narrates only events he actually knows.
</p>
<p><em>Omniscent third person: </em>the story is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has access to all characters' thoughts as well as to all the events, past, present and future, including events that no character knows.
</p>
<p><em>Objective third person: </em>the story is narrated in third person by an external narrator, that has no access to any character's thoughts. Narration has a journalistic style. Narrator has access to all the events, but narration must be developed only through actions and dialogues.
</p>
<p><em>Second person: </em>the story is narrated in second person by an external narrator that addresses directly to the reader.
